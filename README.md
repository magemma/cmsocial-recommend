A task reccomendation system for CMSocial
=========================================

This repository contains an initial version of a task recommendation system to
be used with [CMSocial]{https://github.com/algorithm-ninja/cmsocial}.

It was presented as a project for the "Esperienze di programmazione" course
during my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Using it requires having
a `punteggi.txt` file in the current working directory containing the
`(user_id, task_id, score)` triples.
